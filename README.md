# Ping-to-router-tester

Had an issue with my router dying at random intervals for a small amount of time, so I made this to constantly ping my router when running
it pings every couple of seconds and if the connection fails, it writes the time and date it failed in a .txt file in the local directory.

It also displays the results of the past 10 pings and their average.

This program was the deciding factor in whether or not I bought a new router. New one's been working great. :)

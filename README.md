# Ping-to-router-tester

Had an issue with my router dying at random intervals for a small amount of time, so I made this to constantly ping my router when running
it pings every couple of seconds and if the connection fails, it writes the time and date it failed in a .txt file in the local directory.

It also displays the results of the past 10 pings and their average and the time of the last disconnect.

This program was the deciding factor in whether or not I bought a new router. New one's been working great. :)

Also, this was one of the first real things I wrote and did so before I had an idea of objects. It still has some short comings and a whole rewrite would be good for it, but it still does what it sets out to do.
